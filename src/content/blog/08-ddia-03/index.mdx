In my [last post](https://danils.xyz/blog/07-ddia-02) I talked about log-structured storage and
SSTables. This post is still about chapter 3, and it's not gonna be the last either. Because
chapter 3 covers a lot of interesting things. In this post I'm gonna talk about PostgreSQL,
how's the storage mechanism works, how are data stored, how indexing works, and more.

In the book, at a glance it wasn't really obvious how to draw a comparison between log-structured storage and page-oriented
storage because the way Martin Kleppmann writes the material is he talked about each paradigm at a different level.
For log-structured storage, he talks at the data layout level, he explains clearly how data are laid out on disk.
But for page-oriented storage he only talks at the indexing level without ever touching how data are laid out on disk.
It confused me a bit at first before I realize this.

It's not really a problem, but I thought it's somewhat unfortunate given the depth of the book that it doesn't
include such material (if I remember correctly there's no such thing either in the later chapters). So this post
is also my attempt to bridge that gap. I'm gonna talk about page-oriented storage at the same level as how I talked
about the log-structured storage in the previous post. I decided to pick Postgres as the study case since it's so
popular nowadays. Fortunately, Postgres has an elaborate documentation explaining the internal working of their
storage mechanism.

## Pages

The most basic unit of storage in Postgres is called a **page** or a **block** (both means the same thing
and can be used interchangeably). With each page by default having 8KB of size.
Each page contains the data of multiple rows, so it's basically a grouping mechanism.

When it needs to read a row, Postgres determines in which page the desired row is
located at, and fetch the whole page. So even we only want 1 row (A), it will fetch every row
in the same page as row A. The same goes for writing, it overwrites the whole page.
This is where the term "page-oriented storage" comes from.
Most major RDBMSs uses this paradigm too.

Each page has the following structure:

_Animation here_

It's basically divided into 3 parts, the page header, the row pointers, and the rows themselves.

The first question one might ask given this information is probably: "Why split the data into pages?"

There are several reasons to this, the following are some of it:

1. **More efficient disk I/O**:
2. **Fits B-Tree indexing nicely**:
3. **Better data locality**:

## TOASTs

A row in Postgres is not allowed to span multiple pages. But what happens if there's value so large
that it makes the row overflows the 8KB page limit?

That's where the TOAST comes in.

TOAST stands for "The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique". The idea to offload the big values of
a row into a separate storage mechanism. When a value is TOASTed, the original row in the page
only contains a reference to it. This prevents a row to span multiple pages.

Not every built-in data types is TOASTable, here's some examples of the TOASTable ones:

1. `json` and `jsonb`
2. Large text strings (`TEXT`s and `VARCHAR`s)
3. `bytea`
4. Geometric data like path and polygon

There are 2 types of TOASTs.

### On-Disk TOAST Storage

### In-Memory TOAST Storage

In-memory TOAST is only used for short-lived values. According to Postgres' documentation, this was originally
created only as a proof of concept but has stayed since then with limited use.

## Heap Files

Right, but where do these pages located at?

Postgres stores each table's data in something called **heap files**. We can easily determine
where a table's heap file is located by doing:

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

Each table gets a dedicated heap file. Each heap file is made up of segments with the default
maximum size of 1GB per segment. So when a segment reaches this size, a new segment is added to the heap file.
The pages that I talked about are stored in these segments.

## B-Tree Indexing

Postgres actually supports multiple types of indexes, from hash indexing, GIST, to B-Tree indexing.
But I'll only talk about B-Tree indexing because this is what's typically associated by default
to page-oriented RDBMSs and because this is the one Martin Kleppmann talks about in Chapter 3 of DDIA.
