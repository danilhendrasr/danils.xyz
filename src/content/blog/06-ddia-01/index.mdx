There's a running joke in the tech community that everyone recommends the book 
"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" but no one has actually read it.
Well I'm here to tell you that I'm built different from y'all snowflakes.

Just kidding.

But seriously, it's a great book. There's a lot of gems in there.
And just like everyone else, I also recommend this book to anyone who wants to 
level up their knowledge on distributed systems. You'll learn a lot from
the interleaving history of data models, intricacies of different types of storage engines,
challenges in handling distributed systems, and the trade-offs of different design decisions. 

In my [last blog post](https://www.danils.xyz/blog/05-mercurial-cores), 
I've said that I want to start posting my notes on the papers
I've read. Actually aside from that I also want to post my notes on books I've read. 
So because right now I'm in the process of reading DDIA again. I thought it would 
be a good start. Because I already forgot like 90% of the things I've read in the book anyway.
So posting my notes here would be a good way to solidify my understanding of the concepts.

The plan is to write a blog post for each chapter of the book. Which will amount
to 12 blog posts in total. Hopefully I can finish this series before the end of the year.
